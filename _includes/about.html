        <h3>HOME: WATERLOO</h3>
        <p>
          While many Univeristy of Waterloo students are from out-of-town, I was actually born and raised here! I've always enjoyed 
          the comforts of home and am fortunate enough to still be living here with my parents (also University of Waterloo Alumni) 
          and two brothers.

        <h3>VOLLEYBALL</h3>
        <p>
          I'm very involved with the University of Waterloo volleyball club, SERVE! As a SERVE club executive, 
          I've had the opportunity of leading the promotion team, responsible for leading the creation and management 
          of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/wlooserve/" target="_blank">SERVE's social media posts</a>. I also enjoy playing 
          volleyball recreationally and in tournaments with friends!

        <h3>MOTIVATION / CAREER ASPIRATIONS</h3>
        <p>
          I'm very goal-driven and find myself motivated when I receive positive and constructive feedback from others! Although 
          I have a passion for technology and learning new skills, I don't have any particular career aspirations. I'm hoping 
          to keep my options open and flexible while staying relevant and hungry to learn new things!
