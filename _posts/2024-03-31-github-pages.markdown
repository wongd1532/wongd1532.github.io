description: "
I used GitHub Pages to host this website using a public Jekyll theme! I find it easy to start and contribute to projects, but difficult to find the time and commitment to finish. It's nothing impressive considering I just forked someone else's repository, but I'm still proud of myself for finally completing a project!
