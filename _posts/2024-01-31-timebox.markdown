description: "
TimeBox is a new concept calendar and time-manager web app in development. The platform is designed with 
command line navigation, flexible calendar functionality, and shared user experience in mind.
"
involvement: "
This was my first-ever project experience! I was onboarded onto the development team of 5 developers at the 
time and learned so much from my mentor, Bryan, a University of Waterloo Math alumni and volleyball enthusiast. 
Bryan taught me fundamental development skills like version control (git), web development, and relational database 
design. In the time that I worked on this project, I mainly contributed to developing the frontend features, 
but also contributed to expanding our Database Entity-Relationship-Diagram and a few backend tickets.
