job-title: Junior Learning Technologies Analyst
location: In-person | Waterloo, ON
co-op-date: January 2024 to April 2024
skills: Scripting, Web-Scraping, Report-Generation, SQL, Python, PowerShell, IT Support

job-responsibilities: "
Responsible for developing internal automation tools (scripts) to improve process efficiency 
and enhance reliability. The scripts were packaged as applications for ease-of-use by 
non-technical users. Also tasked with learning WatSPEED's student information database, then 
writing queries to generate reports and automate report distribution. Additionally, provided 
customer and internal IT support.
"
takeaway: "
WatSPEED is a very new company (3 years old) which has branched off of an existing and similar 
University of Waterloo department, Centre for Extended Learning (CEL). As such, WatSPEED is 
still very early in its life cycle and I was warned during the co-op interview for this position 
that it was difficult to pinpoint the many responsibilities of the Junior Learning Technologies 
Analyst position. I was thrilled by the idea of being responsible for working on a variety of 
different projects and acquiring different skills! Since there's only been a few co-ops in this 
role before me, I initiated and setup a GitLab space for future co-ops to use version control in 
their projects! I ended up learning and using many scripting skills for my projects such as web 
scraping with Selenium, application packaging with PyInstaller, and scripting email distribution 
with the University of Waterloo's Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP). I also learned SQL to 
retrieve data to generate reports for the Marketing, Client Success, Finance, and Systems & 
Operations teams in WatSPEED. I think WatSPEED was my favourite co-op experience so far because 
I had the freedom to tackle problems and learn new skills as I saw fit. While I appreciated the 
freedom, I also wished that I had a mentor to guide me and point out the errors and inefficiencies 
in my code. For my next co-op, I'm looking for a position where I can receive constructive criticism 
and learn lots from my mentors!
