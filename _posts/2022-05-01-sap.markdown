takeaway: "
SAP was my very first co-op and my first time working a corporate job! Since COVID was still at large, I 
worked from home for most of this term, but went into the office about once a week in the second half of the 
term. When I first went into this co-op, I hadn't declared a major yet and I didn't really know what I wanted 
to do career-wise. I was lucky to be hand-held by very kind mentors who taught me all about technical writing! 
My largest contribution was improving the uniformity and consistency of What's New bulletins on our 
customer-facing product Help Portal. I learned a lot about myself this term. While I genuinely enjoyed technical 
writing, I felt too cushioned at SAP. I yearned to grow independently and take on larger responsibilities 
in my future co-ops.
