job-title: Technical Writer
location: Hybrid | Waterloo, ON
co-op-date: May 2023 to August 2023
skills: Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA), Technical Writing, Oxygen XML Editor

job-responsibilities: "
I was tasked with learning, owning, and managing the product bulletin processes with minimal supervision. 
I also authored and edited mechatronics documentation for warehouse automation products using Oxygen XML Editor 
adhering to Dematic's style guide.
"
takeaway: "
I really enjoyed technical writing, and considering it as a future career option, I jumped 
at the opportunity to further my technical writing abilities at Dematic! Coming into my 2nd 
co-op, I made it a goal to myself to be more self-dependent and leave a bigger impact at the 
company. Having previous technical writing experience and using similar technologies, I 
onboarded onto the technical writing team very quickly and was very productive. Halfway through 
the term, the technical writer on our team responsible for product bulletins made an internal 
move and offloaded the responsibility onto my manager. I took the initiative to learn, document, 
and significantly improve the product bulletin process to increase process visibility to stakeholders, 
eliminating bottlenecks, and increasing bulletin publishing speed and volume. I had minimal 
supervision from my manager and by the end of the term, I was very proud for demonstrating 
my ability to be more self-dependent while leaving a long-lasting impact at Dematic.
