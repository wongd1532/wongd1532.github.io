description: "
As a student who is extremely involved with the University of Waterloo volleyball community, I often find myself explaining and customizing rotations to other players. Rotation Vision is a volleyball team-planning web app in development which helps visualize volleyball rotations. The app is designed to help users customize, plan, and share legal volleyball rotations.
"
involvement: "
I'm leading a team of 4 developers on this project! We're all fairly new to development, but I'm excited to take on more responsibility and see a project through from start to finish. I contributed to a significant portion of the Rotation Vision UI in Figma which we've just started building out the frontend using React!
